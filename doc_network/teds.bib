    abstract = {We use several sources to collect and evaluate academic scientific publication on a country-wide scale, and we apply it to the case of France for the years 2015â€“2020, while presenting a more detailed analysis focused on the reference year 2019. These sources are diverse: databases available by subscription (Scopus, Web of Science) or open to the scientific community (Microsoft Academic Graph), the national open archive HAL, and databases serving thematic communities (ADS and PubMed). We show the contribution of the different sources to the final corpus. These results are then compared to those obtained with another approach, that of the French Open Science Barometer for monitoring open access at the national level. We show that both approaches provide a convergent estimate of the open access rate. We also present and discuss the definitions of the concepts used, and list the main difficulties encountered in processing the data. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the respective contributions of the main databases and their complementarity in the broad framework of a countrywide corpus. They also shed light on the calculation of open access rates and thus contribute to a better understanding of current developments in the field of open science.},

    title = {Mapping scientific communities at scale},

    year = {2025},

    abstract = {This study introduces a novel methodology for mapping scientific communities at scale, addressing challenges associated with network analysis in large bibliometric datasets. By leveraging enriched publication metadata from the French research portal scanR and applying advanced filtering techniques to prioritize the strongest interactions between entities, we construct detailed, scalable network maps. These maps are enhanced through systematic disambiguation of authors, affiliations, and topics using persistent identifiers and specialized algorithms. The proposed framework integrates Elasticsearch for efficient data aggregation, Graphology for network spatialization (Force Atltas2) and community detection (Louvain algorithm) and VOSviewer for network vizualization. A Large Language Model (Mistral Nemo) is used to label the communities detected and OpenAlex data helps to enrich the results with citation counts estimation to detect hot topics. This scalable approach enables insightful exploration of research collaborations and thematic structures, with potential applications for strategic decision-making in science policy and funding. These web tools are effective at the global (national) scale but are also available (and can be integrated via iframes) on the perimeter of any French research institution (from large research organisms to any laboratory). The scanR community analysis tool is available online https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/networks/get-started. All tools and methodologies are open-source on the repo https://github.com/dataesr/scanr-ui.},
