In this repository, we process publications from [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch) and [IPBES](https://www.ipbes.net) bibliograpgies :
adding information on the organizations, authors and other featuring involved in each publication thanks to [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/).
Our goal is to develop a predictive model that can predict if a publication is related to global warming issues or not.

There is two parts: the vizualization one (link [here](https://dataesr.github.io/presentations/20240311_teds.html) for the first presentation) and the modelization one (link [here](https://dataesr.github.io/presentations/202407XX_teds_model.html) for the model presentation).
